In this project I am cleaning up data in SQL by 
--> Standardizing the date format
--> Populating property address data
--> Breaking out address into individual columns (address, city, state)
--> Changing "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No" in Sold as Vacant field.
--> Removing duplicates
--> Deleting unused columns.
